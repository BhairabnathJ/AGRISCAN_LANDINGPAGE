## Overall Design System

**Typography & Spacing:**
- Implement a fluid type scale with large, confident headlines (hero should be 72-96px on desktop)
- Use generous white space—sections should breathe with 120-160px vertical padding
- Create clear visual rhythm with consistent spacing multipliers (8px base grid)
- Mix font weights strategically: ultra-bold for impact statements, light/regular for body copy

**Color & Depth:**
- Move away from flat backgrounds to subtle gradients and glass-morphism effects
- Add depth with layered elements: floating cards with soft shadows (0 4px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.06))
- Use blur effects on background elements for visual depth
- Implement a sophisticated color palette: deep greens (#1a4d2e primary), soft sage (#e8f3ed backgrounds), warm earth tones for accents
- Add subtle animated gradient meshes in hero section backgrounds

**Motion & Interaction:**
- Add parallax scrolling effects—background elements move slower than foreground
- Implement smooth scroll-triggered animations: fade-up, scale-in, blur-to-focus transitions
- Animate stat counters when they enter viewport
- Add hover states with smooth transforms (scale 1.02, lift with shadow increase)
- Use easing functions like cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1) for premium feel

## Section-by-Section Improvements

### Hero Section
**Current Issues:** Static, cramped, buttons feel small
**Redesign:**
- Increase headline size dramatically, split into multiple lines with animated reveal
- Add animated gradient mesh background with subtle movement
- Make buttons larger (56px height), with primary having animated gradient background
- Add floating device mockup image on right side with subtle float animation
- Implement scroll indicator with animated chevron
- Add particle effects or subtle geometric patterns in background

### Problem Section (Challenge We're Solving)
**Current Issues:** Card layout feels generic, icons are basic
**Redesign:**
- Transform into bento-grid layout with varying card sizes for visual interest
- Add animated gradient borders on cards that activate on scroll
- Implement number counters that animate up from 0 when visible
- Use larger, custom iconography with subtle animations (pulse, rotate)
- Add background texture or pattern to section
- Make stats larger and more prominent—numbers should dominate, labels below

### Solution Section (AgriScan: A Different Approach)
**Current Issues:** Three-column layout is standard, cards lack hierarchy
**Redesign:**
- Create asymmetric layout: center card elevated and larger than flanking cards
- Add glow effects around icons that pulse gently
- Implement staggered fade-in animations (left card first, then center, then right)
- Use frosted glass effect (backdrop-blur) on card backgrounds
- Add subtle gradient background behind entire section
- Make icons 3D or use illustration style instead of simple line icons

### How It Works Section
**Current Issues:** Linear timeline feels flat, lacks engagement
**Redesign:**
- Transform into interactive scrolling experience—each step reveals as you scroll
- Add device mockup images showing actual interface for each step
- Implement animated connection lines between steps that draw in on scroll
- Use larger, bolder step indicators with animated fills
- Add micro-interactions: hovering a step highlights it and shows additional context
- Technical specs should be in expandable card with smooth accordion animation

### Mission & Impact Section
**Current Issues:** Dark green is heavy, cards feel cramped
**Redesign:**
- Use dark section but with gradient overlay and subtle pattern
- Transform impact cards into larger, glowing elements with animated icons
- Implement revealing number animations with trailing effects
- Add parallax effect on background
- Vision statement should be in featured callout box with soft glow
- Consider adding video or animated graphic showing global impact

### Roadmap Section
**Current Issues:** Phase cards look like basic status indicators
**Redesign:**
- Create flowing timeline with animated progress bar connecting phases
- Current phase should glow and pulse gently
- Add hover states that expand cards to show more detail
- Implement icon animations that reflect phase status (spinning for active, checkmark for complete)
- Use z-axis layering: current phase elevated, future phases slightly receded
- Add subtle particle effects flowing from completed to current phase

### Beta Program Section
**Current Issues:** Form feels generic and disconnected
**Redesign:**
- Transform into spotlight moment—form should feel like centerpiece
- Add subtle animated gradient background
- Use larger form fields with floating labels
- Implement real-time validation with smooth feedback
- Benefits section should have animated checkmarks that appear sequentially
- Add visual indicator of form completion percentage
- Create premium-feeling CTA button with animated gradient and hover lift effect

### Team Section
**Current Issues:** Avatar circles are basic, layout is flat
**Redesign:**
- Use larger team photos with sophisticated hover effects (zoom, color shift)
- Add animated role tags that appear on hover
- Implement staggered load animations
- Funding and partners sections should feel more substantial—use larger numbers, add visual elements
- Create cohesive design system for badges/tags

### FAQ Section
**Current Issues:** Standard accordion, lacks personality
**Redesign:**
- Add animated expansion with smooth height transitions
- Use gradient dividers between questions
- Implement icon animations when accordion opens/closes
- Add subtle background color shift on expanded items
- Make expand/collapse indicators more sophisticated (animated plus/minus or rotating chevron)

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Animations:**
- Use Intersection Observer API for scroll-triggered animations
- Implement CSS transforms for smooth 60fps animations
- Add loading states with skeleton screens that animate in
- Use requestAnimationFrame for custom animations

**Performance:**
- Lazy load images below fold
- Use WebP format with PNG fallbacks
- Implement progressive image loading with blur-up effect
- Optimize animations to run on GPU (transform, opacity only)

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach with touch-optimized interactions
- Reduce animation complexity on mobile for performance
- Adjust spacing scale for smaller screens (80px padding on mobile vs 160px desktop)
- Stack complex layouts into single column below 768px

**Accessibility:**
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios despite visual sophistication
- Add reduced-motion media queries to disable animations
- Ensure all interactive elements have proper focus states
- Maintain semantic HTML structure

Build this with React components, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Framer Motion for animations. Focus on creating a cohesive, premium experience that feels like a high-end product launch rather than a student project.
